INSTRUCTIONS
This assignment   has three   parts.   Make sure you   read the   instructions carefully.For Part   1a, collect your reflections from each week’s   Ed   Lesson   and   create   a   single   PDF   document. You   can simply copy/paste your reflections, but   please add   headings for   each week.   Submit   the   PDF   through   the   Moodle Assignment activity.
For Part   1b, you   need to submit two files through the   Moodle Assignment activity:
1)          A   PDF document with the answers to the questions and your workings.
2)          A separate   .zip archive with the   Logisim files(.circ) along with your individualised assignment
specification. To achieve   non-zero marks   Logisim files (.circ) must   be   submitted.
3)       Ignore Turnitin warning   or error   messages for   zip   files   or   other   non-document   files!You   may see the following error message from Turnitin.   But you   only   need to   make   sure   the   .zip   contains the correct files (2   Logisim files and your   individualised truth   table,   in   pdf format)   . You   can   ignore this error message!
Part2   is an   in-class test during your allocated Applied Class   in Week 4.   Instructions will   be   available   in   Moodle and communicated via an announcement   post.


Part   1a:   Reflection (Hurdle - you   MUST submit   it   in order to   pass   this assignment!)Complete your reflection activities   in Week   1 to Week 3   Ed   Lesson and   copy/paste   them   into   a   pdf file.   Each week the   reflection   must   have at   least   100 words (relevant and   meaningful to   the   specific   week).
Failure to submit all   relevant    week’s reflections (mi代 写FIT1047 Introduction to computer systems, networks and security – S2 2024 Assignment 1Python

incomplete submissions) will   result   in your assignment   1   having a maximum mark   of49% only.   For example,   if the overall combined   mark   is 61/100,   it will   be scaled to   49/100.   If   the overall combined   mark   is 44/100 then it will   remain as   44/100.
You   may   use the template   provided   in   Moodle to write down your reflection.
Part   1b:   Boolean Algebra (30 marks total - 50%   of your assignment
1, or 7.5% of your marks   in   the   entire   unit)
Follow the link on   Moodle to access your personalised   truth   table   for this   task.
Important: Your truth table   is different from the one other students are working   on.   Only download the file while you are correctly   logged   into   Moodle with your own   student account.
The truth table you download describes a   Boolean function with four input values   X1,X2,X3,X4   and   two   output   values   Z1,Z2.
The   main   result of this   part will   be a logical circuit correctly   implementing this   Boolean   function in the   Logisim simulator.
Each task   below   needs to be documented and   explained.
Task   1.1:   Boolean Algebra   Expressions   (10   marks)Write the   Boolean function as   Boolean algebra terms using the   Sum of   Product   (SOP)   form.   First, think about   how to deal with the two outputs. Then,   describe   each   single   row   in terms      of Boolean algebra.   Finally, combine the terms for single   rows   into   larger terms.
Briefly explain these steps for your particular truth table (e.g.,   explain   for   one   particular   row         how you come up with the   Boolean terms for that   row, and   then   explain   how   you   combine   all   rows). This explanation should be no   more   than   a   few   sentences.
Also write the   Boolean function as   Boolean algebra terms using the   Product of   Sum   (POS)   form. with brief explanation of steps (e.g. how   you   combine   all   rows).
Correctness of   the result:   7 marks   (marks   will be deducted for   individual errors)
Explanation: 3   marks
Notation:   Use the following symbols and notation for writing   Boolean algebra expressions.            Variables are upper-case (e.g., X1, Z2).   Boolean AND is written without   a   symbol,   e.g.X1X2   .      Boolean OR   is written with the + symbol, e.g. X1      +    X2   .   Negation is written   using   an   overline,   e.g. X1   .   Important: when writing terms like   NOT X1 AND   NOT X2, there must   be a   clear
gap   in the overlines, e.g. X1 X2   . Tip: you can   use the equation function   in Word   or   Google   Docs to create overlines.
Task   1.2:   Logical circuit   in   Logisim   (10   marks)
Model the   resulting   Boolean terms (using SOP form) from Task 2.1   in   a   single   Logisim               circuit,   using only the   basic gates AND, OR,   NOT. You can   use gates with   more   than   two   inputs. See the template on the   last   page   for how to structure your   circuit.
Briefly explain your construction (as for Step   1, a   short   explanation   is   enough).
Test your circuit   using values from the truth table and document   at   least   3 test   cases. You   can take screenshots or your Logisim window to document the tests.
Correctness of   the circuit:   5 marks   (marks   will be deducted for   individual errors including   incorrect/missing labels)
Explanation: 2   marks
Test cases:   1 mark   per documented test case
Task   1.3: Optimised circuit   (10   marks)
The goal of this task   is to find a minimal   circuit   using only   AND,   OR,   and   NOT   gates.   Based   on the truth table and   Boolean algebra terms from Step   1, optimise   the   function   using   Karnaugh maps.
You will   need to create two   Karnaugh   maps, one for each output. Your documentation   must   show
1)      the   maps,
2)      the groups found   in the   maps
3)      the   reduced   Boolean functions derived from the   maps and   how the   maps relate to   terms in the optimised   Boolean functions.
Then   use   Logisim to create a minimal circuit,   using only AND,   OR,   and   NOT   gates.      Test your optimised circuit using values from the truth table   and   document your tests.
Correctness of   Karnaugh maps: 4 marks   (2 for each map, marks   will be   deducted for   individual errors)
Documentation   ofgroups   and   reduced   Boolean   functions: 4 marks
Logisim circuit and documentation: 2 marks   (marks   will be deducted for   individual errors   including incorrect/missing labels)
Part 2:   In-class test   in Week 4 (50% of your assignment   1, or   7.5%   of your marks   in the entire   unit)
This test will assess your   knowledge of number systems   (binary, decimal,   hexadecimal,   octal), character encodings (ASCII) and   Boolean logic   gates. A   sample   quiz   (not   assessed)   will be given to you on   your Week   3   applied   session.
